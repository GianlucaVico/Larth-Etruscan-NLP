# LM

This folder contains the code and notebooks for the language modelling and restoration parts.
It uses the same approach of translation part.

Also, this is not part of the ALP2023 paper.

## Code

* `data_utils.py`: methods to load the tokenizers and the dataset
* `LMLarth.py`: lm classes
* `ngrams.py`: n-gram language modelling
* `run_train.py`: run the training from the terminal
* `temperature.py`: top-k sampling for the transformer language model
* `train_utils.py`: functions used for training
* `train_utils.py`: functions used for training
* `train.py`: main train functions

## Notebooks

* `ngrams.ipynb`: run the n-gram model experiments

## Others

* `model_config.yml`: example of the model configuration file
* `train_config.yml`: example of the train configuration file
